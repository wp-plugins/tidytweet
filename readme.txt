Display your customized and moderated Twitter feed from TidyTweet.

== Description ==

This plugin will display your customized and moderated Twitter feed from [http://tidytweet.com](http://tidytweet.com "TidyTweet").  
TidyTweet helps keep your search-based Twitter feed free from inappropriate language, users, and content through the use of a number of 
settings and filters.  

If you haven't already created an account on TidyTweet, you'll need to go do that first.  From there, you'll need to copy the link for the "RSS Feed" and paste that into the 
widget management area for the TidyTweet widget.
